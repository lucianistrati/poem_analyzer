# Poem analyzer

This analyzer purpose is to work for multiple languages, but initially it is supposed to work just for Romanian poetry. Poetry analysis is the process of investigating a poem's form, content, structural semiotics and history in an informed way, with the aim of heightening one's own and others' understanding and appreciation of the work. The Poetry Analyzer is a tool designed to analyze poems, providing insights into various aspects such as form, content, sentiment, and more. Initially developed to focus on Romanian poetry, the analyzer aims to support multiple languages in the future.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Poetry Analyzer is to delve into the intricate layers of poetry, unraveling its form, content, structural semiotics, and historical context. By doing so, it seeks to enhance understanding and appreciation of poetry, both for individuals and audiences.

## Features
